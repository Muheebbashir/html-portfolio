<h1>About Me</h1>
Hi! I'm **Muheeb Bashir Baba**, a 20-year-old passionate software developer from Kashmir. I'm currently pursuing my **B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering** at the **University of Kashmir**.

I discovered my love for coding early on and have been hooked ever since. Whether it's building full-stack applications, solving algorithmic challenges, or experimenting with new technologies, I enjoy every bit of the development process. I'm constantly learning and always looking for opportunities to grow as a developer.

When I'm not immersed in code, you'll probably find me watching movies — I'm a huge fan of storytelling through cinema. I believe creativity fuels innovation, and I love bringing both into my work.

I'm currently open to exciting opportunities where I can contribute, collaborate, and continue pushing my limits as a developer.

Let’s build something awesome together!
